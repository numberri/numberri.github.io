## $ whoami
I'm berri, a university student studying Computer Science with as much math as my degree allows. I'm also involved in running my uni's cybersecurity society, and will occasionally do CTFs.
I hope to be posting some of my write-ups here!
<br>
I like crypto, but crypto does not like me. I may also do other categories as well - I'm currently working on getting better at web exploitation.

When I'm not doing cybersecurity/coding/math stuff, I enjoy gaming on Nintendo consoles, hiking, going on walks, running, going to cafés and playing bass guitar. I sometimes write, make music, and draw, but I'm not very good at it.
