## $ whoami
I'm berri, a university student studying Computer Science with as much math as my degree allows. I'm also involved in running my uni's cybersecurity society, and will occasionally do CTFs.
I hope to be posting some of my write-ups here!

<br>
I like crypto, but crypto does not like me. I also often do forensics, and try to dabble in other categories as well.

<br>
When I'm not doing cybersecurity/coding/math stuff, I enjoy gaming on Nintendo consoles, hiking, going on walks, rock climbing, going to caf√©s and playing bass guitar. I sometimes write poems, music, and draw, but I'm not very good at them.
