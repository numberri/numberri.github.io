## Welcome
This Github pages will be used mostly for CTF Writeups, although I may eventually put blog posts on here as well.

## whoami
I'm berri, a university student studying Computer Science with as much math as my degree allows. I'm also involved in running my uni's cybersecurity society, and will occasionally do CTFs.
<br>
I like crypto, but crypto does not like me. I also often do forensics, and try to dabble in other categories as well.
