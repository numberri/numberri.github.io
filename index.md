title: numberri's writeups

## Welcome
This Github pages will be used mostly for CTF Writeups, although I may eventually put blog posts on here as well.

## whoami
I'm berri, a university student studying Computer Science with as much math as my degree allows. I'm also involved in running my uni's cybersecurity society, and will occasionally do CTFs.
<br> <br>
I like crypto, but crypto does not like me. I also often do forensics, and try to dabble in other categories as well.

## Contact
If you want to contact me, you can do so through email - here's my email in hex for anti-spam: 626972646d6f64654070726f746f6e2e6d65

You can also find me on some platforms under numberri or cyberri.
