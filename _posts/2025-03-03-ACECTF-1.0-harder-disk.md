## Alternative tiltle for this one: How noob ways of thinking can shoot you in the back
<br>


***One of the first things I learnt when I started learning to hack was linux. It was fun until I hit a ceiling of understanding about the differences in Operating Systems, what's a Shell, Kernel, etc.***

<br>

***But once I got better I started developing a liking towards the terminal and how the Linux operating system is better than say Windows, or worse in some cases. How none of them is superior, nor the other inferior. We shall find out with this challenge.***

 <br>

***Be careful, a lot of fake galfs around.***

<br>

For the challenge you were given an unmarked file named [challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZv94aEKV4Mc33sJECWVqqAEPiXHhCd-/view). Upon running `file challenge`, you see that it is a Windows file system.

<br>
I change the file to `challenge.iso` and I mount it. Naively, I try to strings and grep for the flag:

```sh
for i in *; do strings "$i" | grep -e ACECTF; done
```
<br>
With this I am rewarded with...

```

...And so on. Overall, 1830 lines of fake "galf"s and no real flag. Clearly, I need a different approach - and I hopefully have learned my lesson that if I get a bunch of fake flags while using `grep`, I probably have the wrong approach.

<br>

## A new approach, and a bit of hindsight

<br>

If you have ever worked with NTFS before, you may have heard of [Alternate Data Streams - ADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Alternate_data_stream_(ADS)) - on Windows. The TLDR of it is that more than one data stream can be associated with one file, with the format `filename.extention:streamname`. This can hold metadata, malware, or... flags.

<br>

On Linux, you can use `testdisk` to look at these alternate data streams. On selecting the mounted disk image, selecting `Advanced`, and then `List`, I can look at what files are on the disk - and what data streams exist on the files. Lo and behold...

<br>

The file `666c61672e747874.jpg` has a flag and key! The data stream `666c61672e747874.jpg:Flag` has the string `CTCHHW{7t3_h1hw3p3sq3_s37i33r_a0l_4li_a3}`, and `666c61672e747874.jpg:Key` has the string `cryforme`. After this, it's a simple Vigenère decode:

<br>

![Image]({{site.url}}/assets/images/harder-disk/got_the_flag.png){: .post-img }

<br>

This gets the flag: `ACECTF{7h3_d1ff3r3nc3_b37w33n_y0u_4nd_m3}`
