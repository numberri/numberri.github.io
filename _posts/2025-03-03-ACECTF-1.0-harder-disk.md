## Alternative tiltle for this one: How noob ways of thinking can shoot you in the back

For the challenge you were given an unmarked file named [challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tZv94aEKV4Mc33sJECWVqqAEPiXHhCd-/view). Upon running `file challenge`, you see that it is a Windows file system.

I change the file to `challenge.iso` and I mount it. Naively, I try to strings and grep for the flag:
```sh
for i in *; do strings "$i" | grep -e ACECTF; done
```
With this I am rewarded with...

```

...And so on. Overall, 1830 lines of fake "galf"s and no real flag. Clearly, I need a different approach - and I hopefully have learned my lesson that if I get a bunch of fake flags while using `grep`, I probably have the wrong approach.

## A new approach, and a bit of hindsight

If you have ever worked with NTFS before, you may have heard of [Alternate Data Streams - ADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Alternate_data_stream_(ADS)) - on Windows. The TLDR of it is that more than one data stream can be associated with one file, with the format `filename.extention:streamname`. This can hold metadata, malware, or... flags.

On Linux, you can use `testdisk` to look at these alternate data streams. On selecting the mounted disk image, selecting `Advanced`, and then `List`, I can look at what files are on the disk - and what data streams exist on the files. Lo and behold...

![Image]({{site.url}}/assets/images/harder-disk/success.png){: .post-img }

The file `666c61672e747874.jpg` has a flag and key! The data stream `666c61672e747874.jpg:Flag` has the string `CTCHHW{7t3_h1hw3p3sq3_s37i33r_a0l_4li_a3}`, and `666c61672e747874.jpg:Key` has the string `cryforme`. After this, it's a simple Vigen√®re decode:

![Image]({{site.url}}/assets/images/harder-disk/got_the_flag.png){: .post-img }

This gets the flag: `ACECTF{7h3_d1ff3r3nc3_b37w33n_y0u_4nd_m3}`
